# Python-Projects

A collection of all my projects coded in just Python

### Endless Math
A mathematics "game‚Äù to help my younger siblings practice their mathematics. They are both in their early primaries, and so the mathematics portion of the code did not need to be too complex. Simple addition and subtraction are currently the only functions, but I hope to expand on this in the future.

The code will prompt the user to input the number values they wish to work with. This allows the user to modify the difficulty through adjusting the value of the numbers they work with. The code then prompts the user to set how many questions they wish to answer. Each question will continue to trigger until the correct answer is given or the user exits the program.

###### Setup:
- You will need python 3.x installed.
- Run `endlessMath.py` in your favourite IDE.

###### Whats next: 
I intend to recode this code with JavaScript to improve user accessibility. Users will no longer be required to have python installed on their computer to run the code. Please see Endless Math repository for updates.
